# RainfallPredictingNeuralNetwork
Simple Neural Network Using Keras in Python to predict if it will rain the next day depending on today's factors


A simple implementation of a 2 layered Neural Network developed using Keras package that predicts the rainfall outcome of the next day.
Both layers are Dense layers from tf.keras.layers module
